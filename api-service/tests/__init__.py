# File: tests/__init__.py
# Purpose: Initialize the tests package and document suite layout.
# Layout overview:
# - tests/unit: fast unit tests over pure functions/services with fakes.
# - tests/contract: FastAPI/TestClient boundaries and manual smoke scripts.
# - tests/integration: resource-dependent suites (e.g., Postgres migrations).
