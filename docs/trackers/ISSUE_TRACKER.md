## Backend Issue Tracker

| ID | Title | Description | Status | Owner | Notes |
|----|-------|-------------|--------|-------|-------|
| BE-001 | SSE stream endpoint mismatch | Frontend streams against `/api/v1/agents/chat/stream` while FastAPI exposes `/api/v1/chat/stream`, breaking real-time updates. | Resolved | – | Frontend + smoke test now target `/api/v1/chat/stream`. |
| BE-002 | Conversation history lacked durable storage | Conversation history now persists via Postgres-backed repositories, and the legacy in-memory adapter/flag have been removed. | Completed | – | `.env.compose` ships `DATABASE_URL`, the FastAPI lifespan always boots the async engine, and readiness probes fail fast if Postgres is unavailable. |
| BE-003 | Tool registry lacks agent-specific scoping | `ToolRegistry.get_core_tools()` returns the same tool set for every agent, preventing specialization as catalog grows. | Deferred | – | Parked for a future backlog cycle once we expand multi-agent tooling; no near-term work planned. |
| BE-004 | Authentication is demo-only | `/api/v1/auth` hard-codes demo credentials and issues JWTs without user store or hashing pipeline. | Resolved | – | FastAPI now backs `/api/v1/auth/*` with the new user/service-account pipeline (Postgres users, bcrypt+pepper hashing, EdDSA tokens, contract tests). |
| BE-005 | Multi-agent handoff not configured | `AgentRegistry` provisions specialized agents but never wires `handoffs`, so triage cannot delegate per SDK guidance. | Resolved | – | Triage agent now uses SDK `handoff(...)` with prompt helper and descriptions. |
| DB-001 | Durable conversation schema & migrations | Introduce SQLAlchemy models plus Alembic migration for Postgres conversation/billing tables. | Completed | – | Alembic scaffold + baseline migration `20251106_120000`; CI smoke tests exercise upgrade/downgrade on Postgres. |
| DB-002 | Async engine bootstrap & configuration | Add Postgres engine/session factory, settings, startup validation, and local tooling support. | Completed | – | Async engine + health check implemented; document Docker workflow and production toggles shipped with Make targets + Compose helpers. |
| DB-003 | Conversation repository integration | Implement Postgres-backed repository, wire into agent service, and update tests/tooling. | Completed | – | Repository live with CI coverage (`tests/integration/test_postgres_migrations.py`); retention hooks tracked separately. |
| DB-004 | Agents SDK session integration | Align AgentService with OpenAI Agents SDK session/memory so chat history persists via session tokens. | Completed | – | `agent_conversations` now tracks `sdk_session_id` + sync metadata, the FastAPI lifespan wires the shared SQLAlchemy session store, AgentService runs chats with SDK sessions, and integration tests cover session persistence across restarts. |
| DB-005 | Billing service scaffold | Ship plan catalog, subscription lifecycle, usage recording, and tests over the Postgres repository. | Completed | – | `BillingService` drives `/api/v1/billing/*`, backed by `PostgresBillingRepository` + Stripe gateway stubs, with comprehensive unit coverage. |
| DB-006 | API & health hardening | Expose database-aware readiness probes, update docs, and ensure Compose defaults include Postgres settings. | Completed | – | `/health/ready` now calls `verify_database_connection()`, `.env*` ship `DATABASE_URL`, and docs describe failure modes + setup flow. |
| BILL-001 | Billing service & API scaffolding | Deliver tenant-scoped billing commands (start/update/cancel/usage) with role guards and Stripe-ready hooks. | Completed | – | Backend + frontend now cover dispatcher orchestration, Redis/SSE payloads, retry tooling, verification suites (`make test-stripe`, CLI replay integration test), and runbooks/metrics so operators can replay or monitor billing flows without touching live Stripe. |
| AUTH-001 | Threat model & auth requirements | Document JWT consumers, threat boundaries, and approve Ed25519 rollout scope. | Completed | – | Approved via `docs/auth/idp.md` + `docs/security/auth-threat-model.md`; feeds milestone kickoff doc and security review checklist. |
| AUTH-002 | Ed25519 key management service | Implement key lifecycle module, secure storage contract, and rotation playbooks. | Completed | – | Simplified single-key storage backed by file/Vault adapters plus the `auth keys rotate` helper (replaces the active key in place). JWKS endpoint and CLI tooling verified 2025-11-07. |
| AUTH-003 | JWT service refactor | Swap PyJWT to EdDSA signer/validator with strict claim schema and pluggable backends. | Completed | – | **Nonce cache decision:** reuse the Redis revocation cluster with a dedicated prefix (`auth:nonce:*`) and max TTL 5 min; no local in-process fallback remains.<br>**Storage hardening:** `service_account_tokens.refresh_token_hash` now stores bcrypt(+pepper) digests using `AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_PEPPER`, truncating legacy plaintext rows via migration `20251106_230500` (satisfies threat-model R10).<br>**Signer refactor:** `TokenSigner`/`TokenVerifier` now wrap the active Ed25519 key from `KeySet`, and refresh tokens persist `signing_kid` (`migration 20251106_235500`) so reuse + revocation rehydrate the correct JWS. Contract + unit suites cover tampering, unknown `kid`, and expiry paths; coverage gate met. |
| AUTH-004 | JWKS publishing endpoint | Expose active/next public keys, add caching headers, and verify Next.js consumption. | Completed | – | JWKS responder now serves only active/next keys, attaches `Cache-Control`, strong `ETag`, and `Last-Modified`, and returns 304s when `If-None-Match` matches. `KeySet.materialize_jwks()` caches DTOs until kids/schema change, settings gained `AUTH_JWKS_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` + `AUTH_JWKS_ETAG_SALT`, and `auth jwks print` CLI command plus Prom counters (`jwks_requests_total`, `jwks_not_modified_total`) shipped. Contract tests cover 200/304 flows; docs updated so consumers poll ≤max-age and honor ETags. |
| AUTH-005 | Auth observability & alerts | Instrument structured logs, metrics, and alerts on token failures/rotation drift. | Removed | – | Starter scope stops at exposing `/metrics` plus structured logs; Slack/PagerDuty automation dropped as out-of-scope polish. |
| AUTH-006 | Staged rollout & postmortem | Run dual-signing canary, monitor, cutover to EdDSA-only, and capture lessons. | Removed | – | No staged rollout required before the codebase is public; treat as future ops checklist if production environments emerge. |
| IDP-001 | Human auth requirements & threat model | Document user lifecycle, password policy, lockouts, auditing fields, and external IdP compatibility. | Completed | – | Approved 2025-11-07: `docs/auth/idp.md` + `docs/security/auth-threat-model.md` baseline downstream scope; handoff to IDP-002. |
| IDP-002 | User data model & migrations | Ship Alembic migration for `users`, `user_profiles`, `user_login_events`, plus seed tooling. | Completed | – | Migration `0e52ba5ab089` applied (make migrate) with ORM models + seed utility; docs/env updated 2025-11-07. |
| IDP-003 | User domain & service layer | Implement `UserRepository`/`UserService`, lockout helpers, bcrypt+pepper hashing, and extend `AuthService` for user login/refresh. | Completed | – | Repository + service stack merged with Redis-backed lockouts, bcrypt+pepper hashing, and comprehensive unit tests; CI coverage gate met. |
| IDP-004 | Auth API & contract updates | Replace demo `/auth/token` with service-backed login, add register/reset stubs, ensure responses carry token metadata + RBAC context. | Completed | – | `/api/v1/auth` login/refresh now call the new services, user metadata exposed via `/auth/me`, refresh rotation enforced, and contract suite `tests/contract/test_auth_users.py` green; OpenAPI regenerated. |
| IDP-005 | Frontend login UX | Update Next.js frontend with real login/logout, secure cookie storage, silent refresh, and protected routes. | Completed | – | Login page, server actions, secure cookie helpers, middleware guard, silent refresh hook, and Playwright smoke test landed in `agent-next-15-frontend`. |
| STRIPE-01 | Settings & Secrets Baseline | Add Stripe config fields, env docs, and startup guards so billing can’t boot without credentials. | – | Completed | FastAPI lifespan now enforces Stripe env vars when `ENABLE_BILLING=true`, logs masked `stripe_config` summaries, and `docs/billing/stripe-setup.md` includes the troubleshooting matrix + log samples. |
| STRIPE-02 | Developer Setup Script | Build `scripts/stripe/setup.py` (CLI checks, Postgres helper, env writers) modeled after the reference script lines 33‑320; include an "easy setup" action that opens Stripe’s guided install/auth page before continuing. | – | Completed | Python helper now provisions Starter/Pro products + prices (7-day trial), captures `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`/`STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, writes the JSON `STRIPE_PRODUCT_PRICE_MAP`, and documents the flow in `docs/scripts/stripe-setup.md`. |
| STRIPE-03 | Stripe Gateway Implementation | Replace stubbed `StripeGateway` with full customer/subscription/usage calls plus retries and observability. | – | Completed | Gateway now wraps the typed Stripe client with structured logs, Prom counters/histograms, domain error codes, and unit tests covering metrics + usage/idempotency flows; see `app/services/payment_gateway.py`, `app/observability/metrics.py`, and `tests/unit/test_stripe_gateway.py`. |
| STRIPE-04 | Webhook Intake & Event Store | Add FastAPI webhook endpoint, event tables, signature verification, and reconciliation flows; persist every Stripe event type even if only some update state today. | – | Completed | Shipping the `stripe_event_dispatch` table + Alembic revision, dispatcher service, webhook wiring, replay CLI overhaul, and BillingService sync entrypoints so webhook → domain updates are auditable and replayable. |
| STRIPE-05 | Real-Time Billing Stream | Implement Redis-backed broadcaster + WebSocket/SSE endpoints and wire the Next.js dashboard to consume updates. | – | Not Started | Touches: new `app/services/billing_events.py`, `app/api/v1/billing/stream.py` (or WS presentation layer), Next.js `agent-next-15-frontend` billing pages/hooks. |
| STRIPE-06 | Test & Ops Tooling | Add automated tests, fixture replay harness, CLI docs, and runbooks for Stripe key rotation + webhook replay. | – | Not Started | Touches: `tests/integration/test_stripe_*.py`, `tests/fixtures/stripe/`, `docs/billing/stripe-runbook.md`, CI config for webhook fixtures. |
