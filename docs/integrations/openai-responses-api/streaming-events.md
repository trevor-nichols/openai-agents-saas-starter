# Streaming events

When you create a Response with stream set to true, the server will emit server-sent events to the client as the Response is generated. This section contains the events that are emitted by the server.

---

## `response.created`

An event that is emitted when a response is created.

<details>
<summary>Properties</summary>

-   **`response`** `object`
    The response that was created.
    <details>
    <summary>Properties</summary>

    -   **`created_at`** `number`
        Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when this Response was created.

    -   **`error`** `object`
        An error object returned when the model fails to generate a Response.
        <details>
        <summary>Properties</summary>

        -   **`code`** `string` - The error code for the response.
        -   **`message`** `string` - A human-readable description of the error.
        </details>

    -   **`id`** `string`
        Unique identifier for this Response.

    -   **`incomplete_details`** `object`
        Details about why the response is incomplete.
        <details>
        <summary>Properties</summary>

        -   **`reason`** `string` - The reason why the response is incomplete.
        </details>

    -   **`instructions`** `string or array`
        A system (or developer) message inserted into the model's context. When using along with `previous_response_id`, the instructions from a previous response will not be carried over to the next response. This makes it simple to swap out system (or developer) messages in new responses.

    -   **`metadata`** `map`
        Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard. Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.

    -   **`model`** `string`
        Model ID used to generate the response, like `gpt-4o` or `o3`. OpenAI offers a wide range of models with different capabilities, performance characteristics, and price points. Refer to the model guide to browse and compare available models.

    -   **`object`** `string`
        The object type of this resource - always set to `response`.

    -   **`output`** `array`
        An array of content items generated by the model. The length and order of items in the output array is dependent on the model's response. Rather than accessing the first item in the output array and assuming it's an assistant message with the content generated by the model, you might consider using the `output_text` property where supported in SDKs.

    -   **`parallel_tool_calls`** `boolean`
        Whether to allow the model to run tool calls in parallel.

    -   **`temperature`** `number`
        What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.

    -   **`tool_choice`** `string or object`
        How the model should select which tool (or tools) to use when generating a response. See the `tools` parameter to see how to specify which tools the model can call.

    -   **`tools`** `array`
        An array of tools the model may call while generating a response. You can specify which tool to use by setting the `tool_choice` parameter. We support the following categories of tools:
        *   **Built-in tools:** Tools that are provided by OpenAI that extend the model's capabilities, like web search or file search. Learn more about built-in tools.
        *   **MCP Tools:** Integrations with third-party systems via custom MCP servers or predefined connectors such as Google Drive and SharePoint. Learn more about MCP Tools.
        *   **Function calls (custom tools):** Functions that are defined by you, enabling the model to call your own code with strongly typed arguments and outputs. Learn more about function calling. You can also use custom tools to call your own code.

    -   **`top_p`** `number`
        An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with `top_p` probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

    -   **`background`** `boolean`
        Whether to run the model response in the background. Learn more.

    -   **`conversation`** `object`
        The conversation that this response belongs to. Input items and output items from this response are automatically added to this conversation.
        <details>
        <summary>Properties</summary>

        -   **`id`** `string` - The unique ID of the conversation.
        </details>

    -   **`max_output_tokens`** `integer`
        An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a response, including visible output tokens and reasoning tokens.

    -   **`max_tool_calls`** `integer`
        The maximum number of total calls to built-in tools that can be processed in a response. This maximum number applies across all built-in tool calls, not per individual tool. Any further attempts to call a tool by the model will be ignored.

    -   **`output_text`** `string` (SDK Only)
        SDK-only convenience property that contains the aggregated text output from all `output_text` items in the `output` array, if any are present. Supported in the Python and JavaScript SDKs.

    -   **`previous_response_id`** `string`
        The unique ID of the previous response to the model. Use this to create multi-turn conversations. Learn more about conversation state. Cannot be used in conjunction with `conversation`.

    -   **`prompt`** `object`
        Reference to a prompt template and its variables. Learn more.
        <details>
        <summary>Properties</summary>

        -   **`id`** `string` - The unique identifier of the prompt template to use.
        -   **`variables`** `map` - Optional map of values to substitute in for variables in your prompt. The substitution values can either be strings, or other Response input types like images or files.
        -   **`version`** `string` - Optional version of the prompt template.
        </details>

    -   **`prompt_cache_key`** `string`
        Used by OpenAI to cache responses for similar requests to optimize your cache hit rates. Replaces the `user` field. Learn more.

    -   **`prompt_cache_retention`** `string`
        The retention policy for the prompt cache. Set to `24h` to enable extended prompt caching, which keeps cached prefixes active for longer, up to a maximum of 24 hours. Learn more.

    -   **`reasoning`** `object` (gpt-5 and o-series models only)
        Configuration options for reasoning models.
        <details>
        <summary>Properties</summary>

        -   **`effort`** `string` - Constrains effort on reasoning for reasoning models. Currently supported values are `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `xhigh`.
        -   **`generate_summary`** `string` (Deprecated) - Use `summary` instead.
        -   **`summary`** `string` - A summary of the reasoning performed by the model. One of `auto`, `concise`, or `detailed`.
        </details>

    -   **`safety_identifier`** `string`
        A stable identifier used to help detect users of your application that may be violating OpenAI's usage policies. The IDs should be a string that uniquely identifies each user. We recommend hashing their username or email address, in order to avoid sending us any identifying information. Learn more.

    -   **`service_tier`** `string`
        Specifies the processing type used for serving the request. Can be `auto`, `default`, `flex`, or `priority`.

    -   **`status`** `string`
        The status of the response generation. One of `completed`, `failed`, `in_progress`, `cancelled`, `queued`, or `incomplete`.

    -   **`text`** `object`
        Configuration options for a text response from the model. Can be plain text or structured JSON data.
        <details>

        -   **`verbosity`** `string` - Constrains the verbosity of the model's response. Supported values are `low`, `medium`, and `high`.

        An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.

    -   **`truncation`** `string`
        The truncation strategy to use for the model response. Can be `auto` or `disabled` (default).

    -   **`usage`** `object`
