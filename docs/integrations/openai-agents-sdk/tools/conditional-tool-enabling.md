# Conditional Tool Enabling

You can conditionally enable or disable agent tools at runtime using the `is_enabled` parameter. This allows you to dynamically filter which tools are available to the LLM based on context, user preferences, or runtime conditions.

```python
import asyncio
from agents import Agent, AgentBase, Runner, RunContextWrapper
from pydantic import BaseModel

class LanguageContext(BaseModel):
    language_preference: str = "french_spanish"

def french_enabled(ctx: RunContextWrapper[LanguageContext], agent: AgentBase) -> bool:
    """Enable French for French+Spanish preference."""
    return ctx.context.language_preference == "french_spanish"

# Create specialized agents
spanish_agent = Agent(
    name="spanish_agent",
    instructions="You respond in Spanish. Always reply to the user's question in Spanish.",
)

french_agent = Agent(
    name="french_agent",
    instructions="You respond in French. Always reply to the user's question in French.",
)

# Create orchestrator with conditional tools
orchestrator = Agent(
    name="orchestrator",
    instructions=(
        "You are a multilingual assistant. You use the tools given to you to respond to users. "
        "You must call ALL available tools to provide responses in different languages. "
        "You never respond in languages yourself, you always use the provided tools."
    ),
    tools=[
        spanish_agent.as_tool(
            tool_name="respond_spanish",
            tool_description="Respond to the user's question in Spanish",
            is_enabled=True,  # Always enabled
        ),
        french_agent.as_tool(
            tool_name="respond_french",
            tool_description="Respond to the user's question in French",
            is_enabled=french_enabled,
        ),
    ],
)

async def main():
    context = RunContextWrapper(LanguageContext(language_preference="french_spanish"))
    result = await Runner.run(orchestrator, "How are you?", context=context.context)
    print(result.final_output)

asyncio.run(main())
```

The `is_enabled` parameter accepts:

*   **Boolean values**: `True` (always enabled) or `False` (always disabled)
*   **Callable functions**: Functions that take `(context, agent)` and return a boolean
*   **Async functions**: Async functions for complex conditional logic

Disabled tools are completely hidden from the LLM at runtime, making this useful for:

*   Feature gating based on user permissions
*   Environment-specific tool availability (dev vs prod)
*   A/B testing different tool configurations
*   Dynamic tool filtering based on runtime state
