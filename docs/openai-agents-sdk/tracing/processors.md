set_api_key

set_api_key(api_key: str)
Set the OpenAI API key for the exporter.

Parameters:

BatchTraceProcessor
Bases: TracingProcessor

Some implementation notes: 1. Using Queue, which is thread-safe. 2. Using a background thread to export spans, to minimize any performance issues. 3. Spans are stored in memory until they are exported.

__init__

__init__(
    exporter: TracingExporter,
    max_queue_size: int = 8192,
    max_batch_size: int = 128,
    schedule_delay: float = 5.0,
    export_trigger_ratio: float = 0.7,
)
Parameters:

Name	Type	Description	Default
exporter	TracingExporter	The exporter to use.	required
max_queue_size	int	The maximum number of spans to store in the queue. After this, we will start dropping spans.	8192
max_batch_size	int	The maximum number of spans to export in a single batch.	128
schedule_delay	float	The delay between checks for new spans to export.	5.0
export_trigger_ratio	float	The ratio of the queue size at which we will trigger an export.	0.7

shutdown

shutdown(timeout: float | None = None)
Called when the application stops. We signal our thread to stop, then join it.

force_flush

force_flush()
Forces an immediate flush of all queued spans.
